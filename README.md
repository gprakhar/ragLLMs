# ragLLMs
My experiments with RAGbots.
RAGbot_on-Wikipedia-Pages.ipynb - I use a Collab Notebook to access Genmini model on Google's vertexAI. The content is wikipedia pages, which are summarized by LLM and then stored in Cosmo vector DB. The same LLM is used for retrival. Langchain is the glue.
gemini-RAG-tutorial_Sep2024.ipynb - This is a tutorial I did and modified to not use image data.
