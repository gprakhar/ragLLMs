# ragLLMs
My experiments with RAGbots.
RAGbot_on-Wikipedia-Pages.ipynb - I use a Collab Notebook to access Genmini model on Google's vertexAI. The context is specific wikipedia pages, which are summarized by LLM and then stored in Croma vector DB. The same LLM is used for retrival. Langchain is the glue.
gemini-RAG-tutorial_Sep2024.ipynb - This is a tutorial I did and modified to not use image data. 
Simple-RAG_Langchain-Langsmith.ipynb - A simple code for RAG implemmentation, using Langchain native functions. Langsmith is initialized for Trace.
